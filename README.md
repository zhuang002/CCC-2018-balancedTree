Test Status: 

    Partially passed. Time out for Java
    
Branches

    master: Partially passed. Java. Netbean Projects. The DMOJ shows the testcase is not valid for Java. I believe I have had the 
    best performance using dynamic planning. There should be a mathematic general fomular for the f(n). Leave it for later maths class.
